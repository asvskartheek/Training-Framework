# Spine Dataset
This is a simple Binary Classification Problem. [Dataset source](https://www.kaggle.com/sammy123/lower-back-pain-symptoms-dataset). Architecture is nothing novel either, it is a simple FNN with no regularization layers. 

My first attempt with [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) training loop, absolutely loved the simplicity hehe.
